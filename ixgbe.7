.SH OVERVIEW
.sp
This driver supports Linux* kernel versions 2.6.x and newer. However, some
features may require a newer kernel version. The associated Virtual Function
(VF) driver for this driver is ixgbevf.
.sp
Driver information can be obtained using ethtool, lspci, and ip. Instructions
on updating ethtool can be found in the section Additional Configurations later
in this document.
.sp
This driver is only supported as a loadable module at this time. Intel is not
supplying patches against the kernel source to allow for static linking of the
drivers.
.sp
For questions related to hardware requirements, refer to the documentation
supplied with your Intel adapter. All hardware requirements listed apply to use
with Linux.
.sp
This driver supports XDP (Express Data Path) on kernel 4.14 and later and
AF_XDP zero\-copy on kernel 4.18 and later. Note that XDP is blocked for frame
sizes larger than 3KB.

.SH IMPORTANT NOTES
.SS Do not unload port driver if VF with active VM is bound to it
.sp
Do not unload a port\(aqs driver if a Virtual Function (VF) with an active Virtual
Machine (VM) is bound to it. Doing so will cause the port to appear to hang.
Once the VM shuts down, or otherwise releases the VF, the command will complete.
.SS Configuring SR\-IOV for improved network security
.sp
In a virtualized environment, on Intel(R) Ethernet Network Adapters that
support SR\-IOV, the virtual function (VF) may be subject to malicious behavior.
Software\-generated layer two frames, like IEEE 802.3x (link flow control), IEEE
802.1Qbb (priority based flow\-control), and others of this type, are not
expected and can throttle traffic between the host and the virtual switch,
reducing performance. To resolve this issue, and to ensure isolation from
unintended traffic streams, configure all SR\-IOV enabled ports for VLAN tagging
from the administrative interface on the PF. This configuration allows
unexpected, and potentially malicious, frames to be dropped.

With kernel 3.6, the driver supports the simultaneous usage of \fBmax_vfs\fP and
DCB features, subject to the constraints described below. Prior to kernel 3.6,
the driver did not support the simultaneous operation of \fBmax_vfs\fP greater
than 0 and the DCB features (multiple traffic classes utilizing Priority Flow
Control and Extended Transmission Selection).
.sp
When DCB is enabled, network traffic is transmitted and received through
multiple traffic classes (packet buffers in the NIC). The traffic is associated
with a specific class based on priority, which has a value of 0 through 7 used
in the VLAN tag. When SR\-IOV is not enabled, each traffic class is associated
with a set of receive/transmit descriptor queue pairs. The number of queue
pairs for a given traffic class depends on the hardware configuration. When
SR\-IOV is enabled, the descriptor queue pairs are grouped into pools. The
Physical Function (PF) and each Virtual Function (VF) is allocated a pool of
receive/transmit descriptor queue pairs. When multiple traffic classes are
configured (for example, DCB is enabled), each pool contains a queue pair from
each traffic class. When a single traffic class is configured in the hardware,
the pools contain multiple queue pairs from the single traffic class.
.sp
The number of VFs that can be allocated depends on the number of traffic
classes that can be enabled. The configurable number of traffic classes for
each enabled VF is as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
0 \- 15 VFs = Up to 8 traffic classes, depending on device support
.IP \(bu 2
16 \- 31 VFs = Up to 4 traffic classes
.IP \(bu 2
32 \- 63 VFs = 1 traffic class
.UNINDENT
.sp
When VFs are configured, the PF is allocated one pool as well. The PF supports
the DCB features with the constraint that each traffic class will only use a
single queue pair. When zero VFs are configured, the PF can support multiple
queue pairs per traffic class.
.SS LRO
.sp
Valid Range: 0 (off), 1 (on)
.sp
Large Receive Offload (LRO) is a technique for increasing inbound throughput
of high\-bandwidth network connections by reducing CPU overhead. It works by
aggregating multiple incoming packets from a single stream into a larger
buffer before they are passed higher up the networking stack, thus reducing
the number of packets that have to be processed. LRO combines multiple
Ethernet frames into a single receive in the stack, thereby potentially
decreasing CPU utilization for receives.
.sp
This technique is also referred to as Hardware Receive Side Coalescing
(HW RSC). 82599, X540, and X550\-based adapters support HW RSC. The
LRO parameter controls HW RSC enablement.

.sp
Valid Range: 0, 41\-10000
.sp
This parameter enables or disables DMA Coalescing (DMAC) feature. Values are in
microseconds and set the internal DMA Coalescing internal timer.
.sp
DMAC is available on Intel(R) X550 (and later) based adapters.
.sp
DMA (Direct Memory Access) allows the network device to move packet data
directly to the system\(aqs memory, reducing CPU utilization. However, the
frequency and random intervals at which packets arrive do not allow the system
to enter a lower power state. DMA Coalescing allows the adapter to collect
packets before it initiates a DMA event. This may increase network latency but
also increases the chances that the system will enter a lower power state.
Turning on DMA Coalescing may save energy with kernel 2.6.32 and newer. DMA
Coalescing must be enabled across all active ports in order to save platform
power.

.SS Configuring the Driver on Different Distributions
.sp
Configuring a network driver to load properly when the system is started is
distribution dependent. Typically, the configuration process involves adding an
alias line to \fB/etc/modules.conf\fP or \fB/etc/modprobe.conf\fP as well as editing
other system startup scripts and/or configuration files. Many popular Linux
distributions ship with tools to make these changes for you. To learn the
proper way to configure a network device for your system, refer to your
distribution documentation. If during this process you are asked for the driver
or module name, the name for the Base Driver is ixgbe.
.sp
For example, if you install the ixgbe driver for two adapters (eth0 and eth1)
and want to set the interrupt mode to MSI\-X and MSI, respectively, add the
following to \fBmodules.conf\fP or \fB/etc/modprobe.conf\fP:

Packet loss may have a greater impact on throughput when you use jumbo
frames. If you observe a drop in performance after enabling jumbo frames,
enabling flow control may mitigate the issue.
.IP \(bu 2

.SS Speed and Duplex Configuration
.sp
In addressing speed and duplex configuration issues, you need to distinguish
between copper\-based adapters and fiber\-based adapters.
.sp
In the default mode, an Intel(R) Ethernet Network Adapter using copper
connections will attempt to auto\-negotiate with its link partner to determine
the best setting. If the adapter cannot establish link with the link partner
using auto\-negotiation, you may need to manually configure the adapter and link
partner to identical settings to establish link and pass packets. This should
only be needed when attempting to link with an older switch that does not
support auto\-negotiation or one that has been forced to a specific speed or
duplex mode. Your link partner must match the setting you choose. 1Gbps speeds
and higher cannot be forced. Use the autonegotiation advertising setting to
manually set devices for 1Gbps and higher.

.SS Filters to Direct Traffic to a Specific VF
.sp
It is possible to create filters that direct traffic to a specific Virtual
Function. For older versions of ethtool, this depends on the \fBaction\fP
parameter. Specify the action as a 64\-bit value, where the lower 32 bits
represent the queue number, while the next 8 bits represent the VF ID. Note
that 0 is the PF, so the VF identifier is offset by 1. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ethtool \-U <ethX> flow\-type tcp4 src\-ip 192.168.10.1 dst\-ip \e
192.168.10.2 src\-port 2000 dst\-port 2001 action 0x800000002 [loc 1]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBaction\fP field specifies to direct traffic to Virtual Function 7
(8 minus 1) into queue 2 of that VF.
.sp
Newer versions of ethtool (version 4.11 and later) use \fBvf\fP and \fBqueue\fP
parameters instead of the \fBaction\fP parameter. Note that using the new ethtool
\fBvf\fP parameter does not require the value to be offset by 1. This command is
equivalent to the above example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ethtool \-U <ethX> flow\-type tcp4 src\-ip 192.168.10.1 dst\-ip \e

Note that these filters will not break internal routing rules, and will not
route traffic that otherwise would not have been sent to the specified VF.
.SS Flex Byte Intel Ethernet Flow Director Filters
.sp
The driver also supports matching user\-defined data within the packet payload.
This flexible data is specified using the \fBuser\-def\fP field of the ethtool
command in the following way:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
+\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-+\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-+

.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\&... user\-def 0x4FFFF ...
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
tells the filter to look 4 bytes into the payload and match that value against
0xFFFF. The offset is based on the beginning of the payload, and not the
beginning of the packet. Thus:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
flow\-type tcp4 ... user\-def 0x8BEAF ...
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
would match TCP/IPv4 packets which have the value 0xBEAF 8 bytes into the
TCP/IPv4 payload.
.sp
Note that ICMP headers are parsed as 4 bytes of header and 4 bytes of payload.
Thus to match the first byte of the payload, you must actually add 4 bytes to
the offset. Also note that ip4 filters match both ICMP frames as well as raw
(unknown) ip4 frames, where the payload will be the L3 payload of the IP4 frame.
.sp
The maximum offset is 64. The hardware will only read up to 64 bytes of data
from the payload. The offset must be even because the flexible data is 2 bytes
long and must be aligned to byte 0 of the packet payload.
.sp
The user\-defined flexible offset is also considered part of the input set and
cannot be programmed separately for multiple filters of the same type. However,
the flexible data is not part of the input set and multiple filters may use the
same offset but match against different data.

DCB is a configuration Quality of Service implementation in hardware. It uses
the VLAN priority tag (802.1p) to filter traffic. That means that there are 8
different priorities that traffic can be filtered into. It also enables
priority flow control (802.1Qbb) which can limit or eliminate the number of
dropped packets during network stress. Bandwidth can be allocated to each of
these priorities, which is enforced at the hardware level (802.1Qaz).
.sp
DCB is normally configured on the network using the DCBX protocol (802.1Qaz), a
specialization of LLDP (802.1AB). The ixgbe driver supports the following

If your Intel Ethernet Network Connection is not working after installing the
driver, verify that you have installed the correct driver.
.sp
Intel(R) Active Management Technology 2.0, 2.1, and 2.5 are not supported in
conjunction with the Linux driver.
.SS Receive Error counts may be higher than the actual packet error count
.sp
When a packet is received with more than one error, two bad packets may be
reported. This affects all devices based on 10G, or faster, controllers.
.SS MAC address of Virtual Function changes unexpectedly
.sp
If a Virtual Function\(aqs MAC address is not assigned in the host, then the VF
(virtual function) driver will use a random MAC address. This random MAC
address may change each time the VF driver is reloaded. You can assign a static
MAC address in the host machine. This static MAC address will survive a VF
driver reload.
.SS SR\-IOV virtual functions have identical MAC addresses
.sp
When you create multiple SR\-IOV virtual functions, the VFs may have identical
MAC addresses. Only one VF will pass traffic, and all traffic on other VFs with
identical MAC addresses will fail. This is related to the
\fBMACAddressPolicy=persistent\fP setting in
\fB/usr/lib/systemd/network/99\-default.link\fP\&.
.sp
To resolve this issue, edit the \fB/usr/lib/systemd/network/99\-default.link\fP
file and change the \fBMACAddressPolicy\fP line to \fBMACAddressPolicy=none\fP\&. For
more information, see the systemd.link man page.
.SS Multiple Interfaces on Same Ethernet Broadcast Network
.sp
Due to the default ARP behavior on Linux, it is not possible to have one system
on two IP networks in the same Ethernet broadcast domain (non\-partitioned
switch) behave as expected. All Ethernet interfaces will respond to IP traffic
for any IP address assigned to the system. This results in unbalanced receive
traffic.
.sp
If you have multiple interfaces in a server, turn on ARP filtering by entering
the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/arp_filter

Due to known hardware limitations, RSS can only filter in a maximum of 16
receive queues.
.sp
82599, X540, and X550\-based network connections support up to 64 queues.
.SS Lower than expected performance
.sp
Some PCIe x8 slots are actually configured as x4 slots. These slots have
insufficient bandwidth for full line rate with dual port and quad port devices.
In addition, if you put a PCIe v4.0 or v3.0\-capable adapter into a PCIe v2.x
slot, you cannot get full bandwidth. The driver detects this situation and
writes one of the following messages in the system log:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
PCI\-Express bandwidth available for this card is not sufficient for optimal
performance. For optimal performance a x8 PCI\-Express slot is required.
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
or:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
PCI\-Express bandwidth available for this device may be insufficient for
optimal performance. Please move the device to a different PCI\-e link with
more lanes and/or higher transfer rate.\(dq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If this error occurs, moving your adapter to a true PCIe v3.0 x8 slot will
resolve the issue.
.SS Running \fBethtool \-t <ethX>\fP command causes break between PF and test client
.sp
When there are active VFs, \fBethtool \-t\fP will only run the link test. The driver
will also log in syslog that VFs should be shut down to run a full diagnostic
test.
.SS Unable to obtain DHCP lease on boot with Red Hat
.sp
In configurations where the auto\-negotiation process takes more than 5 seconds,
the boot script may fail with the following message:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
<ethX>: failed. No link present. Check cable?
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This error may occur even though the presence of link can be confirmed using
\fBethtool <ethX>\fP\&. In this case, try setting \fBLINKDELAY=30\fP in
\fB/etc/sysconfig/network\-scripts/ifdfg\-<ethX>\fP\&.
.sp
The same issue can occur during a network boot (via PXE) on Red Hat
distributions that use the dracut script:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Warning: No carrier detected on interface <ethX>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this case, add \fBrd.net.timeout.carrier=30\fP at the kernel command line.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Link time can vary. Adjust the \fBLINKDELAY\fP value accordingly.

.SS Host may reboot after removing PF when VF is active in guest
.sp
Using kernel versions earlier than 3.2, do not unload the PF driver with
active VFs. Doing this will cause your VFs to stop working until you reload
the PF driver and may cause a spontaneous reboot of your system.
.sp
Prior to unloading the PF driver, you must first ensure that all VFs are
no longer active. Do this by shutting down all VMs and unloading the VF driver.
.SS Out of memory issues on IA32 systems
.sp
The driver may consume a lot of memory based on the number of CPUs and network
interfaces. This leads to memory segmentation. Thus, the driver may not be
able to allocate enough memory. To resolve this, reduce the number of
descriptors using ethtool \-G or the number of queues through the RSS parameter.
.SS VLAN tags are stripped on kernels earlier than 2.6.36
.sp
In order to support DCB, kernels earlier than 2.6.36 strip VLAN tags for
VLAN0. This ensures connectivity using 802.1p frames between kernels that
have built\-in support and kernels that do not.
.sp
If the VLAN tags are necessary AND DCB is NOT used, disable VLAN stripping
on older kernels at build time with the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
make CFLAGS_EXTRA=\-DIXGBE_DISABLE_8021P_SUPPORT
